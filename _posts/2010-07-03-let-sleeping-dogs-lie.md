Here's the story in one (code) line:

<code>
find ./ -name *.* -type f -exec s -i "s/group/og/g" '{}' \;
</code><br/>

For the humans amongst us, I'll explain. As part of the rewrite of Organic groups to Drupal 7, I thought that the name also deserves a rename -- to follow Drupal's naming standards. Since there weren't enough votes in the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/75988/">poll</a> in g.d.o I've decided <em>not</em> to go with the change. OG module will keep its name - although in the UI we will use "Group" (the same way as node is refereed to as content).

I'll commit all the changes that are currently in github back to OG's cvs, after <a href="http://drupal.org/node/629484">Add entity key label</a> will land.

Yet another advantage of <a href="http://cyrve.com/d7cx">#d7cx</a> - decisions can be undone.
