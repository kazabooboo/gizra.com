You might have already heard, that <a href="http://cyrve.com/maintainership">Moshe Weitzman</a> has handed over Organic groups to me. It's fun and scary at the same time.

It's is now time for some community "tough love" - OG7 needs reviews.
Before people start diving into the code, you should realize that OG has changed and its concept has been polished and can be summarized into one line:
<blockquote>
OG brings roles and permissions to the <em>group</em> level.
</blockquote>

While porting to Drupal 7 I tried to bring OG to be up to date with all the new standards. Old timers in OG might be a bit disoriented at first, but remember OG is just trying to copy Drupal in the look and feel.

Development has been done on <a href="http://github.com/amitaibu/OG---Drupal7">github</a>, and I have created a new CVS release. If you find any issue please report them on OG's issue queue.
For some overview you can also read <a href="http://drupal.org/node/567840">this issue</a>.

Let's make OG7 the best release ever!
