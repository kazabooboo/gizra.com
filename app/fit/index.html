        <h3>You’ve been down this road before.</h3>
        <p>
          You have learned that there are a range of possible outcomes, and even though the project 
          launched, the end result didn’t quite hit the mark. It's probably because of one of the 
          following: 1. it wasn't on time, 2. it wasn't within budget, or 
          3. the users weren't happy.
        </p> 
        <h3>There is another way.</h3>
        <p>
           Why would you compromise? You don’t need to accept that project work is imperfect, that cost 
           and time overruns are inevitable, and that your users can’t be totally happy. Our 
           approach &mdash; called “<a href="/#gizra-way">The Gizra Way</a>” &mdash;  cuts through the 
           nonsense and uses simple, but radical tools to bring you a successful project.  Projects can be on time, 
           within budget and yes, even with happy users.

                We turn the process on it’s head by <strong>creating a common language and setting expectations</strong> early on.
