I am sure  you have noticed that  the era of the public telephone booths is coming to end. The fact is that on NYC streets there are only four public pay phone booths left standing - waiting for Superman to change his costume or (more likely) to  give a homeless person break from the cold. I wouldn’t bother to note that striking revelation except that recently I have started a tight personal relationship with a phone booth (and not one of those [remaining relics](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.798488,-73.9708797,3a,75y,331.88h,66.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sA4uG2WJ2hYS7mpq2EPwO7g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) a few blocks from my house.

Most of my work days start inside one. Sitting in a small dark cell, speaking with someone from Gizra HQ, located a across an ocean from me. 

## Have we mentioned our US office before? 

Gizra expanded to the what some people say is the greatest city in the world, operating from a co-working space in Manhattan. The booth provides not just privacy but is also is the right thing to do when working is such an environment. I doubt that the guy I am sharing a power strip with cares to hear me speaking about Drupal modules , NYC tax breaks for startups, or Brice’s daughter’s ear infection. 

Out of the total of 20-plus Gizra team, there more and more of us who work remotely from the headquarters. Some of them are in Israel but live far away (well, relativity) from the city of Tel Aviv, and others, on different continents altogether. This is a challenge for all of us all around -  those that work remotely, and those that work from desks in the main office - how not to be strangers to each other, and how to feel that we are part of the same team, sharing the same culture, visions, values, and even internal jokes.  
How Gizra does it as a company, (or learning how to do it) we will keep for a future post. 
I would like to go back to the phone booth.  

## Co-working space etiquette - The Gizra Way 

After few months  here,  I came up with the Gizra Way [link] for co-working space etiquette. This is not one of those “do not steal someone else's food from the fridge or don't bring stinky meals.” If you don’t know that  - then you should look for a real social behavior help.

1. <b>Time box your day (and have your headphones on)</b> : When working by yourself without anyone around to interrupt you, it’s easy to be carried away and not notice that you have been researching hotels for an upcoming trip to DC for more than hour now. Fix a time period for every task in order to put boundaries on the task so that you don’t need to skip lunch (see #2).  I use a timer that alerts me every 25 min, and encourages me to take quick mental breaks. In Gizra, we use our own grassroots system to log in project contributions hours, we call it Productivity [link to module]. Why the headphones? This is the open space equivalent for “do not disturb” sign. If your co-space neighbors  do not know that - move to a different desk or different space altogether. 

2. <b> Do not eat at your desk/laptop: </b> Go out to get lunch, and if the weather permits, eat outside. Packing your own lunch or ordering in? Take a real break from work and your screen, and have it in the common area. You won't be sitting there by yourself for too long and that person sitting next to you might be someone who is looking for your expertise, or who could help you on a project that you’re working on.

3. <b> Investment in community:</b> One of Gizra’ core values is contributing to Open Source projects. Treat the co-working space as your community and finds ways to share your knowledge or expertise with your peers: mentorship program, seminars, free tips and if you feel very happy - through a happy hour event.

4. <b> Step out your comfort zone:</b> and go to a happy hour event… 

5. <b> Pack your stuff and go home (or to the nearest bar):</b> When your finish your work day. We don't believe 14 hours work days are more efficient. In fact, it's most likely less efficient, so even if your neighbors are working late, you should leave to be fresh tomorrow. If you do not have your own friends, family, or hobbies - exercise # 4 and drag the amigos around you to the nearest a watering hole.

6. <b> Just be kind: </b> Good rules of life don’t change according to where you are.

7. <b> yeah , use the phone booth for your phone and skype calls:</b>  it is a throwback for old times.
