Part of my job is to get my hands dirty with technologies I stumble upon. I've decided to have a go at React. Well, one thing led to the other and it seems I went down the client side rabbit hole. I'd like to share with you my path - watch out though, it's a slippery slope.

  <div class="caption">"Hello World" in <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a></div>

It all started with this [Thinking Flux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS188xDYE-u1ShQmFFGbrk0v&t=621&v=nYkdrAPrdcw) video which explains the problems Facebook faced in its front-end and the new application architecture they are now using.

Since the Flux concept was out, different libraries were written implementing it, but in my view it seems that [Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/) is the winner in terms of simplicity, popularity, docs and community. I really recommend going over it - at least the intro and basics. You might be tempted to actually learn a bit of React ([tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)) to follow the examples more easily.

Then I saw Redux was crediting [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) for some of its inspiration, so I decided to give it a quick look. I was immediately blown away by Elm. The syntax is weird (unless you know Haskell), it has a crazy learning curve, but a lot of it makes so much sense.

The following recording is a presentation I first gave internally for Gizra devs, then as a BoF in DrupalCon Barcelona, and finally recorded to share it with everyone.

My goal is to get more people excited about Elm so the community and contributions grows. I feel it is now very much like Drupal about 10 years ago - a small community, far from being mainstream, but with a lot of potential.

Maybe if we'll draw from Drupal's experience in building and cultivating a community we'll be able to bring this awesome tool closer to the mainstream.
