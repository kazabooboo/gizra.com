#Phone Booth
I guess you noticed that that the era of the public telephone booth is coming to end. I would not call it a striking revelation. The fact is  that on Nyc streets  only 4 public pay phone booths have left standing. Waiting for superman to change his custom  or (most likely) to  give a homeless person break from the cold.  
I would not bother you -or even myself -with that striking revelation unless recently I have started a tight personal relationships with a phone booth. <b> And </b> I am not talking about one the ramming relics few blocks from my house. Most of my working days start inside one,
Setting in a small dark cell , speaking with someone from Gizra HQ, which located a across an ocean from me.
