The 2nd Elm - TLV meetup was lots of fun. But it was in Hebrew, and the intersection
between Hebrew speakers and Elm devs is still very limited.

So I've re-recorded my presentation in English. If you haven't ever seen Elm, or
already develop in Elm and want to better understand "how to think Elm" this presentation
might give you a nudge in the right direction.
