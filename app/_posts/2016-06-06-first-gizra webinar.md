Today we held our inaugural <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/thegizraway">#thegizraway</a> webinar. The web series is intended to showcase some of "The Gizra Way" principles - a set of best practices and methodologies, borrowed from the Open Source development world and applied to operations, workflow, and overall company culture.

For the first in the series, we chose the topic of price estimations because it provides a real - and perhaps radical - example of how transparent communication from the beginning about a projects needs alongside it's budget can turn the process on it's head. In the video below Amitai Burstein discusses how a budget-and time-driven discovery process gets a project off on the right foot.
