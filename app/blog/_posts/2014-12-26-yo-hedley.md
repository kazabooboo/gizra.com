Bingo! I think we're on to something here. It's called [yo hedley](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley) - and it's one command that brings a true headless Drupal to _everybody_.

In my last DrupalCon BoF presentation "[Gizra - we've got your headless covered](content/gizra-we-have-got-your-headless-covered/)" I've taken the time to explain why "headless" was in fact mostly a buzzword. While I encourage you to have a look at the presentation, I'm actually more excited about telling you why I feel this is no longer the case. 

Go ahead an check the [live demo](http://hedley-demo.gizra.com/)!

My argument so far was that as a community we were lacking best practices for building a fully decoupled website. Saying Drupal can do headless based on project profiles companies have built isn't very fair for the average developer. They probably have no clue where to start - that's in contrast to saying, for example, that doing complex queries and displays is possible in Drupal, since Views can be used by anyone, and there are best practices around _how_ to use Views.

Hedley is an opinionated approach to building decoupled webapps. It's based on several projects we have already built, taking the best from each. You simply type ``yo hedley`` and it installs your installation profile, configures AngularJS, copies Behat and installs Composer, Bower and NPM. Wooh!  

In fact all that is left to do is to ``cd client`` and ``grunt serve`` and login with demo / 1234.

In this post I could have gone over all the different components and best practices that are bundled in Hedley, such as how to write a [RESTful resource](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley/blob/master/app/templates/skeleton/modules/custom/skeleton_restful/plugins/restful/node/events/1.0/SkeletonEventsResource.class.php#L8) that references another one, how to use AngularJS [UI-Router](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley/blob/master/app/templates/client/app/scripts/app.js#L75-L99), how to write [migrate handlers](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley/blob/master/app/templates/skeleton/modules/custom/skeleton_migrate/handlers/node/SkeletonCompaniesMigrate.php#L8) or how to write [Behat](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley/blob/master/app/templates/behat/features/login.feature#L1) tests that use PhantomJS.  

I could have even expanded on the idea of the generator itself, and how it allows us to encapsulate the entire knowledge we have gained so far, and _keep updating it_.

However, I won't. Instead, I'd like encourage all the geeks out there to give it a spin, poke the code, find things you think should improve and [contribute](https://github.com/Gizra/generator-hedley/#contribute) them back. 

It's almost 2015, and we can do amazing things together!
